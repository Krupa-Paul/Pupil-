# Pupil-
  Pupil+ is a device used to measure the changes in pupil response to light stimulus. The device outputs the pupil responses of both right and left eyes in a video file along with a text file containing the time stamps. The program associated with the device finds and plots the area of pupil from the given video file. A plot is obtained showing the change in area of pupil w.r.t time. Also a CSV file is obtained after processing each video file which saves the data corresponding to Area, State of light and Time for each frame.
  The CSV files and the plots are saved with the same name as that of the video file with .csv and .jpg extensions respectively.
  
Pre-requisites:
1. Create different folders named Videos, Plots and CSV for input video files, figure plots and csv files respectively.
